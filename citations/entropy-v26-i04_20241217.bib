ABSTRACT = {Social media platforms have surpassed cultural and linguistic boundaries, thus enabling online communication worldwide. However, the expanded use of various languages has intensified the challenge of online detection of hate speech content. Despite the release of multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions implementing cutting-edge machine learning techniques, the scarcity of data, especially labeled data, remains a considerable obstacle, which further requires the use of semisupervised approaches along with Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) techniques. This paper introduces an innovative approach, a multilingual semisupervised model combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), more precisely mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Our approach proves its effectiveness in the detection of hate speech and offensive language in Indo-European languages (in English, German, and Hindi) when employing only 20% annotated data from the HASOC2019 dataset, thereby presenting significantly high performances in each of multilingual, zero-shot crosslingual, and monolingual training scenarios. Our study provides a robust mBERT-based semisupervised GAN model (SS-GAN-mBERT) that outperformed the XLM-RoBERTa-based model (SS-GAN-XLM) and reached an average F1 score boost of 9.23% and an accuracy increase of 5.75% over the baseline semisupervised mBERT model.},
